TL;DR: This is a guide for anyone new to Linux, or that have never used Linux before. After reading the guide, you should be able to switch to Linux, or at least know more about it and why many people use it.

## What is Linux?

You can think of Linux as an alternative to Windows and MacOS; An operating system for your computer.

An OS is responsible for managing the computer's physical components (hardware) and code (software). It acts as a 'bridge' between the two, allowing them to work together. Most computers come with Windows pre-installed, and Apple Macs come with MacOS, so why should one consider switching to Linux instead?

Linux is open-source, meaning that anyone can read, distribute and contribute to the project however they see fit. Some may argue that, since the code can be read for anyone, bad actors can more easily find security flaws, but that is far from the thruth. Because so many developers work on Linux, security flaws are quickly discovered and fixed, before they bring any harm to the users. It is much harder to introduce a bug, let alone allowing it to exist for long. This makes linux much more secure than Windows or MacOS.

Linux is also less resource-intensive, so you can run heavier programs and get the most out of your computer. If you use an Android device, Chromebook, or even smart home devices, you are already using Linux.

No entity controls Linux, due to its open nature, so you will always be private while using Linux by itself; It doesn't collect any user data, doesn't have paid features, and doesn't force you to see any ADs.

The disadvantage of Linux (which is improving a lot over time) is software support. Some apps such as Photoshop and Microsoft Word, and games like League of Legends and Roblox, don't work on Linux. Before switching to Linux, make sure all your programs are supported, and if not, try to find other free and open alternatives, like Kritta or GIMP instead of Photoshop, or Google Docs, LibreOffice or OnlyOffice to replace Microsoft Word.

## The first step: Choose a base distribution

One of the best features of Linux is that you can customize it and use it however you like. Instead of a global Linux OS, you get to choose a distribution. Linux itself is just a Kernel - like an engine, that can be used to power any distribution.

A Linux distro bundles the Linux Kernel, a Desktop Environment and some free and open-source programs to help you get started.

There are hundreds of distros, but only three will be more relevant to you:

- Debian Linux
- Arch Linux
- Fedora Workstation

These are often used as a base for other distros to build upon.

To get started, I recommend that you pick Debian-based options, because they are the most widely used, have better support, and are overall more stable. You will find more documentation and help online with these, too.

## Choose your Desktop Environment

Again, there are many DEs, but the two most popular are *GNOME* and *KDE Plasma*.

This choice won't affect how your computer works, but rather how it looks like and how it feels to use. 

GNOME is simple and intuitive, and that makes it harder to customize, but also stable and predictable. You can add features with extensions, and it has the best application ecosystem available. By default, it feels more like MacOS.

KDE Plasma is the most powerful desktop of any operating system. It is very flexible, and you can customize it easily however you see fit. You can change almost everything through the settings, but that also makes it more complex, and so, less intuitive. By default, it looks a lot like Windows 10, but you canmake it look like anything, really. The main downsides are that KDE tends to be more buggy, and applications designed for it are more complex and often lack simpler features.

The choice you make doesn't really matter that much, since you can easily switch between them if you happen to not like one, or prefer the other. If you can, try both, and see which one you like the most. As a general rule, if you came from Windows, try KDE Plasma, and if you came from MacOS, try GNOME first.

## Choose a distribution

Finally, you can decide which distro to install.

If you decided to try GNOME, I recommend the following:

- **Ubuntu** Easy to install and use, a good first option. Includes a dock and some extra features that most people find useful.
- **Debian** Even more stable than Ubuntu. Uses older packages and has a lot more manual configuration, and updates are not as intuitive. Choose Debian only if you are willing to explore and learn more about Linux.

And if you chose KDE Plasma, try:

- **Kubuntu** A derivation of Ubuntu that uses KDE instead. Easy to use and has the best APP support.
- **Debian** Select KDE Plasma when prompted, instead of GNOME. Debian uses an older version of KDE, but it is the most stable distro you can choose. Debian has more manual configuration than Kubuntu, so choose it only if you are willing to learn more about Linux.
- **Linux Mint** Another great option to get started. Has a Cinnamon and KDE version, both are quite simple to use and well-designed. This is the most recommended option for new users, and it feels a lot like Windows 10 out of the box. Choose it if you want something simple and more similar to Windows.
